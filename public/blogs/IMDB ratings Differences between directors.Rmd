Recall the IMBD ratings data. I would like you to explore whether the mean IMDB rating for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton are the same or not. I have already calculated the confidence intervals for the mean ratings of these two directors and as you can see they overlap.

```{r directors, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
#knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "directors.png"), error = FALSE)
```

First, I would like you to reproduce this graph. You may find `geom_errorbar()` and `geom_rect()` useful.

```{r}

# creat dateframe containing confidence intervals data for two directors
director <- c('Tim Burton','Steven Spielberg')
meanrating <- c(6.93,7.57)
lower<- c(6.53,7.27)
upper<- c(7.33,7.87)

df_CIrating<- data.frame(director,meanrating,lower,upper)

# reproduce confidence intervals plot 
ggplot(df_CIrating,aes(x=meanrating,y=factor(director,level = c('Tim Burton','Steven Spielberg')),color=director))+
  geom_linerange(aes(xmin = lower, xmax = upper),width = 2)+
  geom_pointrange(aes(xmin = lower, xmax = upper),size = 1)+
  geom_errorbar(aes(xmin = lower, xmax = upper),size=2,width = 0.05)+
  geom_text(aes(label=meanrating),hjust=0.5, vjust=-1,color="black",size=8,face="bold")+
  geom_text(aes(label=lower,x=lower),hjust=0.5, vjust=-1,color="black",size=5)+
  geom_text(aes(label=upper,x=upper),hjust=0.5, vjust=-1,color="black",size=5)+
  theme_bw() + #delete background
  xlab("Mean IMDB Rating") +
  labs(title = "Do Spielbarg and Burton have the same IMDB ratings?", 
       subtitle = "95% confidence intervals overlap") +
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        axis.title.y = element_blank(),
        axis.title.x = element_text(face = "bold"),
        plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(face = "bold"))+
  geom_rect(color= "grey",fill = "grey", alpha = 0.5, 
    mapping = aes_string(x = "meanrating", y = "director"), 
    xmin = 7.27,
    xmax = 7.33,
    ymin = -Inf,
    ymax = Inf)


```

In addition, you will run a hpothesis test. You should use both the `t.test` command and the `infer` package to simulate from a null distribution, where you assume zero difference between the two.

> Before anything, write down the null and alternative hypotheses, as well as the resulting test statistic and the associated t-stat or p-value. At the end of the day, what do you conclude?

**Null hypotheses: The difference in mean IMDB ratings between Spielbarg and Burton is equal to zero** **Alternate hypotheses: The difference in mean IMDB ratings between Spielbarg and Burton is not equal to zero** **Test statistic for this hypotheses test should be the difference in sample means of ratings for two directors minus the term (μ1-μ2) which is equal to zero in this situation, divided by the standard deviation of the difference between the two sample means** **The associated t-stat = 2.70** **Since the t-stat 2.70 is much greater than 2, we reject the null hypotheses. In conclusion, the mean difference between two directors' movie ratings is really different from zero and therefore there is a significant difference in IMDB rating for them**

You can load the data and examine its structure

```{r load-movies-data}
movies <- read_csv(here::here("data", "movies.csv"))
glimpse(movies)
skimr::skim(movies)
```

Your R code and analysis should go here. If you want to insert a blank chunk of R code you can just hit `Ctrl/Cmd+Alt+I`

```{r}
#Filter original data for two directors only, for t-test convenience

movies_rating1 <- movies%>%
  filter(director==c("Steven Spielberg"))

movies_rating2 <- movies%>%
  filter(director==c("Tim Burton"))

spielberg_burton <- rbind(movies_rating1, movies_rating2)

# Have a look at the statistics of two director rating samples
mosaic::favstats(rating ~ director,data=spielberg_burton)

# Run t-test
t.test(rating ~ director,data=spielberg_burton)


```

```{r}
#Filter original data for two directors only, for simulation 

movies_rating1 <- movies %>%
  filter(director == c("Steven Spielberg"))

movies_rating2 <- movies %>%
  filter(director == c("Tim Burton"))

spielberg_burton <- rbind(movies_rating1, movies_rating2)

#Simulation
set.seed(1234)

ratings_in_null_world <- spielberg_burton %>%
  # Specify the variable of interest
  specify(rating ~ director) %>%
  
  # Hypothesize a null of no (or zero) difference
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  
  # Generate a bunch of simulated samples
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>%
  
  # Find the mean difference of each sample
  calculate(stat = "diff in means",
            order = c("Steven Spielberg", "Tim Burton"))

# Calculate the p-value
ratings_in_null_world %>%
  get_pvalue(obs_stat = 0.64, direction = "both")

ratings_in_null_world %>% visualize()

```

**Both t-test and simulation-based null distribution showed the null hypothesis should be rejected, implying there is a significant difference in IMDB rating for two directors**
