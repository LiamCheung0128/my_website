<p>At the last board meeting of Omega Group Plc., the headquarters of a large multinational company, the issue was raised that women were being discriminated in the company, in the sense that the salaries were not the same for male and female executives. A quick analysis of a sample of 50 employees (of which 24 men and 26 women) revealed that the average salary for men was about 8,700 higher than for women. This seemed like a considerable difference, so it was decided that a further analysis of the company salaries was warranted.</p>
<p>You are asked to carry out the analysis. The objective is to find out whether there is indeed a significant difference between the salaries of men and women, and whether the difference is due to discrimination or whether it is based on another, possibly valid, determining factor.</p>

<p>** We could see that the average salary by gender is different and maleâ€™s are higher than femails. However, the range of average mean of the salary between two gender is likely the same under 95% CI. Considering the relatively small sample size, their MEs are relatively big.</p>
<p>You can also run a hypothesis testing, assuming as a null hypothesis that the mean difference in salaries is zero, or that, on average, men and women make the same amount of money. You should tun your hypothesis testing using <code>t.test()</code> and with the simulation method from the <code>infer</code> package.</p>

<h2>Relationship Experience - Gender?</h2>
<p>At the board meeting, someone raised the issue that there was indeed a substantial difference between male and female salaries, but that this was attributable to other reasons such as differences in experience. A questionnaire send out to the 50 executives in the sample reveals that the average experience of the men is approximately 21 years, whereas the women only have about 7 years experience on average (see table below).</p>

Does your conclusion validate or endanger your conclusion about the difference in male and female salaries?</p>

<p>You can use <code>GGally:ggpairs()</code> to create a scatterplot and correlation matrix. Essentially, we change the order our variables will appear in and have the dependent variable (Y), salary, as last in our list. We then pipe the dataframe to <code>ggpairs()</code> with <code>aes</code> arguments to colour by <code>gender</code> and make ths plots somewhat transparent (<code>alpha  = 0.3</code>).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Look at the salary vs experience scatterplot. What can you infer from this plot? Explain in a couple of sentences</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>There is a positive relationship between salary and experience, and in average with same experience, maleâ€™s salary is relatively lower than femaleâ€™s. However maleâ€™s scale of salary under the same working experience is larger than females. Hence, there might not have significant gender-based salary discrimination.</strong></p>
